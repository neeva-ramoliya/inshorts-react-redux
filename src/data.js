            "description": "<p>YouTube's latest Rewind video, the annual recap touting 'the videos, music and trends that defined YouTube in 2018,' has become the most disliked video ever in the website's history. The previous holder of this dubious title was Justin Bieber's Baby, which over the course of eight years racked up an impressive 9.8 million dislikes. YouTube's 2018 Rewind, meanwhile, charged ahead of this figure in less than two weeks, passing 10 million dislikes (according to LikesCounter) early on December 13th.</p><p>So why all the hate? No one video can appeal to all people, after all. But given the video's whole purpose is to reflect on the year's biggest YouTube moments, there are some very notable omissions. The KSI vs Logan Paul boxing match didn't inspire an inclusion, while the likes of PewDiePie and Shane Dawson didn't get a look in, either. There isn't a mention of the mind-boggling Johny Johny Yes Papa viral video, which was somehow watched nearly 500 million times.</p><p></p>",

Even one year ago the re-election of Narendra Modi as prime minister was an absolute given. Now while he continues to have the advantage, he has no certainties or guarantees; the race is open.</p><p> Both the BJP and the Congress could fumble in their interpretation of this verdict. Here are critical mistakes that either could make — and shouldn’t.</p>",
